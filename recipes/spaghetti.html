  <h2 className="my-5">Ingredients:</h2>
  <p>This is a simple, gluten free lasagna recipe with a prep time of 30 minutes and cook time of 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>* 1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 16 oz bag of shredded cheese</li>
    <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 white onion finely diced</li>
    <li>29 oz can Hunt's Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>24-28 oz bottle jarred tomato basil pasta sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 className="my-5">Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
    <li>
      Set aside one cup of the mozzarella cheese for topping the lasagna later. 
      In a medium bowl, mix together the remaining mozzarella and rest of the cheese 
      mixture ingredients (mozzarella, ricotta, cottage cheese, parmesan, eggs, 
      parsley and pepper) until combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the ground beef and onion. 
      Brown the ground beef, breaking into very small chunks as you do. (The smaller 
      the better so there aren't big chunks of meat in the lasagna.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Spoon a thin layer of sauce onto the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Using 5 
      noodles for the first layer, dip a noodle in the sauce and spread the top of 
      the noodle with a layer of sauce. Place in the pan. Dipping/covering each 
      individual noodle with sauce ensures the noodles will cook through. Repeat 
      with the remaining noodles. You may have to break the 5th noodle in half to 
      fit it along the bottom of the pan. If it breaks no problem, just layer it 
      in the best you can!
